# Innovative Idea

Our application proposes the creation of a movie watchlist, where users can add recently watched films, rate them, and provide comments. The primary aim is to enable users to maintain a record of the movies they have watched and keep track of their opinions on various visual media. We were inspired by rotten tomatoes.

# Data

Qur application will support various data types. Among these, we will be utilizing images to depict the movie thumbnails selected by users. Additionally, we will be working with strings, specifically for the title and comments, and integers to represent the star rating. The application will also include user data such as usernames, emails.

# Functionality

We plan to create a login screen that utilizes Firebase auth and features multiple input fields to enable users to add their movie lists. Additionally, we will construct an API for the front-end that retrieves user data from the database and presents it to the user.

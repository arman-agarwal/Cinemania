# Innovative Idea

Our application proposes the creation of a movie watchlist, this would have several features that will be beneficial to users. One of the primary aims of the application is to allow users to maintain a record of the movies they have watched. This can be helpful for individuals who want to keep track of their viewing history, identify patterns in their movie preferences like which genre they tend to like the most, and later on (when suggesting) remember details about films that they enjoyed or disliked for future use, and to watch similar kind of movies.

Another key feature of the application is the ability for users to rate movies using a star rating system. This will allow users to indicate their level of enjoyment for a particular film and provide a quick reference for their future movie-watching decisions. Additionally, the application will allow users to provide comments on movies they have watched, which can be useful for providing more detailed feedback or sharing their opinions with others.

One of the standout features of the proposed application is the ability for users to share their watchlist with friends in view-only mode. This can be beneficial for users who are looking for movie recommendations from their peers, as they can easily see what movies their friends have watched and enjoyed. Additionally, the ability to view others' watchlists can be a fun way to discover new movies and expand one's viewing repertoire. Moreover, this is also going to be beneficial in the way that it will help users easily give and receive suggestions showcasing their watch history, and opinions.

The proposed application is inspired by Rotten Tomatoes, a popular movie review website. However, the proposed application differs in that it is focused primarily on providing users with a personal movie watchlist and a way to share their opinions with friends. By combining features such as movie ratings, comments, and the ability to share watchlists with friends, the proposed application has the potential to become a valuable tool for movie lovers who want to keep track of their viewing history and engage with others about their movie preferences.

# Data

The proposed movie watchlist application will utilize several different data types to support its functionality. One of the primary data types that the application will support is images. Specifically, the application will use images to depict the movie thumbnails selected by users. These thumbnails will serve as a visual representation of the movies in the watchlist and will help users quickly identify and navigate through their lists. Users would have the ability to edit these thumbnails if they want.

In addition to images, the application will also work with strings. Specifically, strings will be used to represent the movie title and comments. Users will be able to add comments to their movie entries to provide additional context or to share their thoughts on a particular film. The use of strings in this way will allow the application to store and display this text-based information in a user-friendly format, allowing them to share their opinions with you.

Another data type that the application will utilize is integers. Specifically, integers will be used to represent the star rating given by users for each movie. This rating system will allow users to quickly rate their movies on a scale of one to five, with five stars indicating the highest rating. This will be helpful as a quick way to know how much you as the viewer liked it for future, it would also be helpful for the friend you share it with as it would allow them to quickly know how much you liked, and would help them interpret how much they would like based on if you two have the same taste in movies or not.

Finally, the application will include user data such as usernames and emails. This information will be used to create user accounts and to provide a personalized experience for each user. User accounts will allow users to save their watchlists, rate movies, and leave comments on movies they have watched. The use of usernames and emails will also enable the application to implement security features such as authentication and authorization to ensure that user data remains secure and confidential.

In summary, the proposed movie watchlist application will utilize a variety of data types to support its functionality. By using images, strings, and integers, the application will be able to store and display movie-related information in a user-friendly format. Additionally, the inclusion of user data such as usernames and emails will enable the application to provide a personalized experience for each user and ensure that user data remains secure.

# Functionality

We plan to create a login screen that utilizes Firebase authentication. Firebase is a platform that provides various tools and services for building web and mobile applications, including authentication. By using Firebase auth, we can provide users with a secure and seamless login experience. Users will be able to log in using their email and password or their Google or Facebook accounts.

The login screen will feature multiple input fields, such as email and password, to enable users to add their movie lists. Once a user has logged in, they will be able to add movies to their watchlist, rate movies, and leave comments, and also view their previous data. These input fields will be designed to provide a smooth user experience and ensure that the user can easily navigate through the application.

To enable easier data transfer between the frontend and backend, we will utilize an API for the frontend. An API is a set of protocols and tools used for building software applications. The API will retrieve user data from the database and present it to the user in a user-friendly format. This data could include a user's watchlist, their ratings, and comments on movies, among other things.

The API will also enable the frontend to send requests to the back-nd to update user data. For example, when a user adds a new movie to their watchlist, the frontend will send a request to the backend to store this information in the database. This seamless communication between the frontend and backend will ensure that the application functions smoothly and that user data is accurately stored and retrieved.

In summary, the proposed movie watchlist application will feature a login screen that utilizes Firebase auth and multiple input fields to enable users to add their movie lists. An API for the frontend will retrieve user data from the database and present it to the user in a user-friendly format, while also allowing the frontend to send requests to the backend to update user data, and enable easier data transfer between frontend and backend. This approach will ensure a seamless user experience and accurate storage and retrieval of user data.
